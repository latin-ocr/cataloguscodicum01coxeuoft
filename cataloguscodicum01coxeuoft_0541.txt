The books of the Old Testament, according to
the later version of John Wycliffe, with the
general prologue of St. -Jerome and preface.

five books of Moses, ι10511110, Judges, Ruth,
four books of Kings, I. 11. Chronicles, Tobit‚
Judith, Hester, Job, Psalms.

Tit. “ J eron] in his prolog on 110 byble.”

The prologue to the Ι. Kings is written out
of order, at the end of the book.

It is remarkable that the prologues from the

II. Ulironicles to the l’salter inclusive arc
taken from the early version, with slight alter-
ations and trans1‘›ositions of words3 as also
that the prologuc to ι10511110, Kings and Ι.
l'aralip‹›1n.are only found iu the later version
in one other MS, that 1111111011Υ in tlic library
of Ileroford Cathcdral.

in the xivth cent. containing a fragment of
the book of ι1115111111, with a marginal gloss;
in Latin.

Codex membranaceus, 111 4t0 minori, ff. 177,

sec. xv. ineuntis3 haud una manu exaratus;
ex dono Thomae Martio, LLJ). A.D. 1558.

The books of the New Testament according to
the early version of John VVycliffe3 with cor-
rections by the Rubrieator and a third hand.

This MS. has the prefatory verses to St.
Luke's gospel written as a second prologue‚
which are only found in one other MS„ beg-
“ Forsothe for many men enf01·siden.”

It is also peculial· in having very large mar-
ginal glosses from Lyra on the Epistles, and
more particularly on the Acts and Catholie
epistles3 which more properly belong to the
later version.

At. the end of the New Test. ¹‘ Here endith
the Apocalips os Jhesu Orist.⁷’

After-ward, A table of thc lessons 011 the
Sundays and festivals throughout the year in
Latin, intitled, ‘¹ Hic incipiunt eotaeiones
evangeliorum et epistolarum tocius :uini le-
gelide-'⁹

On the first two leaves of the MS.. in the
original hand, are some notes on charity, 011
1 Cor. xiii. also the comnmndmcnts with a
brief comment and on the five bodily and
ghostly wits.

Both the above MSS. have been collated by
the learned editors of ll'ycliffe's Bible now in
the press, to one of whom [sir F. Madden] I
am indebted for the notice of the peculiarities
mentioned.
